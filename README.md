# Weather Prediction Using Analog Ensemble (AnEn) Methods

This repository contains a script that facilitates weather prediction using Analog Ensemble (AnEn) methods.

## Overview

Written by **Murilo Montanini Breve**, the primary function in the script manages several tasks:

- **Data Loading**: Fetch data from `/data/predictor` or `/data/predicted` directories.
- **Data Organization**: Reformulate this data into a sequence of vectors.
- **Prediction**: Use either the AnEn or ClustAnEn methods to generate predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before executing the script, ensure that:

1. Required libraries are installed. These can be found in the `/R/settings/` directory.
2. Desired parameters are verified. Again, look in the `/R/settings/` directory.
3. Run the function `AnEn_methods.R`.

## Results

On successful execution, the script will return predictions based on the provided data and also compare the predicted values to real values, giving a measure of error.

## Additional Notes

The main function is the primary concern, and other secondary functions are utilized to support its operation but aren't described in detail here.

## Usage

To use the main function, `AnEnMethods`, the following parameters are required:

- `params_list`: List of parameters to be used.
- `method`: Prediction method, default is "monache".
- `Pca`: Boolean value determining the use of Principal Component Analysis, default is TRUE.
- `predictors`: Number of predictors, default is 2.
- `variables`: Variables for prediction, default includes "WSPD" and "GST".
- `avail_threshold`: Threshold for data availability, default is 0.85.

```R
AnEnMethods(
  params_list = your_params_list,
  method = "monache",
  Pca = TRUE,
  predictors = 2,
  variables = c("WSPD", "GST"),
  avail_threshold = 0.85
)
