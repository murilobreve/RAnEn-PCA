# Hindcasting-Methods

To run, go to R\settings\run.R

Same other files like: RegressionsAll.R and AnEnAll.R are files to predict all possible variables in the dataset. 

On the other hand, the Regression.R and AnEnMethods.R are the code to predict only one variable. These files are not updated, then I think that it doesn't work directly. 

Any question send to murilobreve@alunos.utfpr.edu
